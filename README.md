## The Experiment
There were two experiments in this study: one that was behavioural only, and another that incorporated EEG recordings. Both experiments used a breaking continuous flash suppression (bCFS) paradigm, where face stimuli were unconsciously presented via dichoptic presentation (i.e. a flashing mask in one eye, a face in the other eye). Participants had to report the orientation of the face image (i.e. tilted 5 degrees either to the left or the right) as quickly and accurately as possible. To do this, they had to wait until the face became visible to them - hence, response times should indicate the earliest reportable time of conscious discrimination.

The experimental paradigm requires PsychToolbox version 3.

## The Data
All raw and processed data from both experiments can be found on the accompanying Open Science Framework project page: https://osf.io/p3du5/

Behavioural data are stored as MATLAB .mat files and EEG data are stored as .BDF files. All data does not contain any identifying information.
