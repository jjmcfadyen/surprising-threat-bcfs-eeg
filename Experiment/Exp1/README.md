# Experiment 1: Paradigm Scripts
This folder contains all the scripts needed to run the paradigm for Experiment 1. Note that you will need:
* PsychToolbox version 3
* Some sort of stimuli in the Stimuli folders (these are missing here due to licensing)

To run, execute the <b>run_bCFS.m</b> file in MATLAB (built on version r2016a) and change folder to the current directory (i.e. the directory structure as it is presented in this repository).

Behavioural data will be saved in .mat files in the Output subfolder.
